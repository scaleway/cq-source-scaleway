A [Scaleway](https://scaleway.com/) source plugin for CloudQuery that loads data from Scaleway to any database, data warehouse or data lake supported by [CloudQuery](https://www.cloudquery.io/), such as PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Athena, and many more.

 - [Supported Tables](docs/tables/README.md)

## Authentication

Credentials are used from the default config file and the environment. Get your credentials from the [IAM dashboard](https://console.scaleway.com/iam/api-keys)

Set credentials in environment variables or use the default config file at `~/.config/scw/config.yaml`. Config format and locations for other platforms are documented in the [SDK Docs](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-sdk-go/tree/master/scw#scaleway-config)

The environment variables to set are:
  - `SCW_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `SCW_SECRET_KEY`
  - `SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID`

Env vars override config values if both are set. Default region and zone is assumed to be `fr-par` and `fr-par-1` respectively if not set.

## Configuration

The following source configuration file will sync all data from Scaleway to a PostgreSQL database. See [the CloudQuery Quickstart](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/quickstart) for more information on how to configure the source and destination.

```yaml
kind: source
spec:
  name: "scaleway"
  path: "scaleway/scaleway"
  version: "${VERSION}"
  # backend: "local" # use this to enable incremental syncing
  tables: 
    - "*"
  skip_tables:
    - "scaleway_marketplace_image_versions"
  destinations: 
    - "postgresql"
  spec:
    # plugin spec section
```

### Plugin Spec

- `timeout_secs` (integer in seconds, optional. Default: 10):
  Timeout for requests against the Scaleway API endpoint.
